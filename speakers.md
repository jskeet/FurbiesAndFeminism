# Speakers

This page is intended (initially, at least) for conference
organizers who want to improve the diversity of their speaker and
attendee lineup. Most resources are around improving speaker
diversity, with an assumption that a diverse set of speakers,
coupled with good inclusion policies (a visible, enforced Code of
Conduct etc) will naturally lead to attendee diversity.
